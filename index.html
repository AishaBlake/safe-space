					# Creating a Safe Space
					## Embracing Diversity in the Workplace
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## My name is Aisha

					- Front-end web developer
					- Teacher of adults and children alike
					- Co-organizer of GDI Detroit
					- Dog enthusiast
					- Coding boot camp instructor
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Problem
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We all need to make diversity in tech a priority. We need to be better.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Solution??
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						There isn't any easy fix. There are lots of interconnected issues.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Neither
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						We'll touch on both, but the focus will be on action items to help us move forward.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## A note on communities

					A lot of the numbers I'll mention are related to women and POC, but the strategies we'll discuss will benefit everyone!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Why You Should Care

					- The population is shifting.
					- We need more talent.
					- Happier employees == less turnover
					- POC are huge consumers.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Diversity improves performance

					- Companies that are very diverse in terms of gender and race tend to perform better financially.
					- Diversity fosters innovation by breaking down bias.
					- Communication within a diverse company tends to be more effective.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## What's the problem again?

					Some would say that we've come a long way and, to an extent, that's true. All of the many _isms_ haven't gone away, though. They're just more subtle.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Second-Generation Bias

					- Lack of role models
					- Stereotypical career paths and tasks
					- Restricted accessibility to networks, mentors, and other forms of professional support
					- Cultural expectations lead to assumptions
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## The Wage Gap

					White Americans hold a disproportionate amount of wealth.

					The vast majority of jobs in the US are attained through friends or family.
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Vocab
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Microaggression

						> "The casual degradation of any socially marginalized group"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Token Hire

						> "A person who is brought into a company dominated by members of a group (or groups) to which they do not belong"
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Intersectionality

						There are lots of interconnected issues present here that cannot be separated.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## You're Not Bad

					We all have biases, but it's easier to attribute bad behaviors to bad people than to take responsibility for our part in the system.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Examine Your Process</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Recruitment</li>
						<li>Onboarding</li>
						<li>Culture</li>
						<li>Responding to bias</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						How are you bringing in more diverse candidates? Why are you doing it? Are there knowledge gaps? Who feels like "one of the group"? Who benefits? Who gets left out? Are you placing the burden/blame on the victim?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Ask for Help

						When you do, remember:

						- You might get it wrong.
							- That’s okay!
							- …But it means you have to try something different.
						- Approach underrepresented groups in a way that’s
							- Respectful
							- Mutually beneficial
					</section>

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Homework

					- Take an implicit attitude test from [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/).
					- Identify one bias you have and three ways it might affect marginalized people around you.
					- Decide on an appropriate response to being called out on your bias.
